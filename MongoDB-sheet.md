# MongoDB 101  
 
* MongoDB is open source NoSQL (not only sql) based document database.  
* When using Atlas MongoDB for first time we will create a cluster of database from their website, create users and IP addresses from where its accessible.  
* So a typical architecture will look like Cluster -> Database -> Collections(Documents).  
* After creating a cluster an empty database will be created on the cluster and a connection string to access it would be provided, which can be used to connect from UI or our applications.  
* An empty DB does not show up in DB list until it's populated with some data or collections.  
* All CRUD commands in MongoDB are through APIs.  
* Collections are similar to tables in RDBMS but have no defined field names and every entry in collection can have its own set of fields.
