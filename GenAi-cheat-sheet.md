# GEN AI - Generative AI

## Common terminology
1. **Models:**  
They go through large datasets in process called **Training** and find patterns and make predictions accordingly. They **DO NOT** store that information, so they cannot work as databases. They do not understand the results they are generating so they wonâ€™t know fact from fiction or recognize a natural pattern it has not been trained on.
2. **LLM vs Foundational Models:**  
An AI model trained on text based dataset is called LLM.
However, all models are also called foundational models (LLM are subpart of it) which is word used to describe other AI models like image, video and audio etc.
3. **MultiModel Ai:**  
MultiModel AI are models that can generate more than one type of data eg. Text and image at same time.
